I need to detect a global hotkey in Python on macOS that works with hyper key remapping apps (like Karabiner-Elements or BetterTouchTool).

CONTEXT:
- I'm using pynput library in Python
- I have a hyper key app that remaps Right Command → Cmd+Option+Control (simultaneously)
- Currently using pynput.keyboard.Listener which detects the RAW Right Command key BEFORE the hyper key transformation
- Other macOS apps correctly see Cmd+Option+Control because they listen AFTER the transformation
- I want to detect Cmd+Option+Control+D hotkey combination

PROBLEM:
pynput seems to intercept at a low system level (CGEvent API?) before hyper key apps transform the key, so it sees "Right Command" instead of "Cmd+Option+Control"

QUESTION:
How can I make pynput (or another Python library) detect hotkeys AFTER hyper key transformation on macOS, so it sees Cmd+Option+Control+D instead of Right Command+D?

Alternative approaches I'm open to:
1. Different pynput configuration/API
2. Different Python hotkey library that operates at higher system level
3. macOS-specific solutions (AppleScript, NSEvent monitoring, etc.)
4. Any Python library that works at the same level as regular macOS apps

Requirements:
- Must work on macOS
- Must detect global hotkeys (work even when app is not focused)
- Must see hyper key transformations like other apps do
- Python-based solution preferred

Please provide specific code examples or library recommendations with implementation details.

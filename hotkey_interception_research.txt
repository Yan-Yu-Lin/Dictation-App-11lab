RESEARCH REQUEST: macOS Global Hotkey Interception in Python with PyObjC

CONTEXT:
I'm building a Python dictation app that uses PyObjC to monitor global hotkeys on macOS. Currently, I'm using NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask_handler_ to detect when the user presses Cmd+Option+Control+D.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
The hotkey detection works perfectly - my app correctly responds to the keypress. However, the keypress also "falls through" to the active application. For example, when the user is in a terminal (Ghostty), the terminal receives the same keypress and interprets it as an escape sequence `[8706;7u`, displaying weird characters.

DESIRED BEHAVIOR:
When the hotkey is pressed, I want to CONSUME/INTERCEPT/BLOCK the event so that:
1. My Python app receives and handles the event
2. The underlying application (terminal, browser, etc.) does NOT receive the event at all
3. This should work system-wide, like how Raycast intercepts its hotkeys

WHAT I NEED TO KNOW:
1. Is addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask_ the wrong API for this? (I suspect it only observes but doesn't consume events)

2. Should I be using CGEventTapCreate instead? If so:
   - What are the exact steps to implement this in PyObjC/Python?
   - What Quartz/Core Graphics imports do I need?
   - How do I create an event tap that can filter/block specific key combinations?
   - How do I return from the event tap callback to indicate "consume this event"?

3. Are there any other macOS APIs I should consider for global hotkey interception that can block event propagation?

4. What accessibility permissions are required, and how do I check/request them programmatically in Python?

5. Please provide a code example in Python using PyObjC that shows:
   - Setting up a global event tap
   - Detecting Cmd+Option+Control+D specifically
   - Blocking/consuming that event so it doesn't reach other apps
   - Integrating with an existing NSApplication event loop

CURRENT CODE STRUCTURE:
- Using NSApplication.sharedApplication() with AppHelper.runEventLoop()
- Asyncio running in a separate thread
- HotkeyMonitor class as NSApplication delegate
- Currently using addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask_ with NSKeyDownMask

Please provide detailed technical guidance with code examples if possible.
